# What Are Cloudflare Tunnels? 🕳️

Cloudflare Tunnels (formerly known as Argo Tunnels) create a secure, outbound-only connection between your server and Cloudflare's global network. This means you can protect your applications without exposing your server's IP address, which significantly enhances your security posture.

### Key Benefits of Using Cloudflare Tunnels:

* **Enhanced Security**: Protects your server from direct exposure to the internet.
    
* **Easy Setup**: Set up with just a few commands—no complex configurations required.
    
* **Global Load Balancing**: Routes traffic efficiently across multiple servers.
    

**Automatic HTTPS**: Ensures secure connections without manual SSL certificate management.

## Story Time: Meet Alex 👨‍💻

Let's illustrate the power of Cloudflare Tunnels with a story. Meet Alex, a web developer who recently launched a personal blog. One evening, while working on a new feature, he decided to test it locally. However, he faced a common dilemma: how to showcase his work without compromising security.

**Enter Cloudflare Tunnels.** With just a few commands, Alex was able to expose his local development server securely. His friends and colleagues could now access his blog at a unique URL without the risk of exposing his local environment to potential attacks.

# How it works ?

Cloudflare Tunnel provides you with a secure way to connect your resources to Cloudflare without a publicly routable IP address. With Tunnel, you do not send traffic to an external IP — instead, a lightweight daemon in your infrastructure (`cloudflared`) creates outbound-only connections to Cloudflare’s global network. Cloudflare Tunnel can connect HTTP web servers, [SSH servers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/use-cases/ssh/), [remote desktops](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/use-cases/rdp/), and other protocols safely to Cloudflare. This way, your origins can serve traffic through Cloudflare without being vulnerable to attacks that bypass Cloudflare.

Cloudflared establishes outbound connections (tunnels) between your resources and Cloudflare’s global network. Tunnels are persistent objects that route traffic to DNS records. Within the same tunnel, you can run as many ‘cloudflared’ processes (connectors) as needed. These processes will establish connections to Cloudflare and send traffic to the nearest Cloudflare data center.

Refer to our [reference architecture](https://developers.cloudflare.com/reference-architecture/architectures/sase/) for details on how to implement Cloudflare Tunnel into your existing infrastructure

## **Installing Cloudflare Tunnel**

Cloudflare Tunnel requires the installation of a lightweight server-side daemon, `cloudflared`, to connect your infrastructure to Cloudflare. If you are [creating a tunnel through the dashboard](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/get-started/create-remote-tunnel/), you can simply copy-paste the installation command shown in the dashboard.

To download and install `cloudflared` manually, use one of the following links.

# Check it cloudflare is correctly installed or not ?

Cloudflare Tunnel can be installed on Windows, Linux, and macOS. as above we will discuss.

Confirm that `cloudflared` is installed correctly by running `cloudflared --version` in your command line:

**Terminal window**

```bash
cloudflared --version
```

### Result shoud be 👇

```bash
cloudflared version 2021.5.9 (built 2021-05-21-1541 UTC)
```

## **Run a local service**

The easiest way to get up and running with Cloudflare Tunnel is to have an application running locally, such as a [React or](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/framework-guides/deploy-a-react-site/) [Svelte site](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/framework-guides/deploy-a-svelte-site/). Whe[n you](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/framework-guides/deploy-a-react-site/) are [develo](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/framework-guides/deploy-a-svelte-site/)ping an application with these frameworks, they will often make use of a `npm run develop` script, or something similar, which mounts the application and runs it on a [`localhost`](http://localhost) port. For example, the popular `create-react-app` tool runs your in-development React application on port `3000`, making it accessible at the [`http://localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000) address.

## **Start a Cloudflare Tunnel**

With a local development server running, a new Cloudflare Tunnel can be instantiated by running `cloudflared tunn`[`el` in](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/framework-guides/deploy-a-react-site/) a ne[w comm](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/framework-guides/deploy-a-svelte-site/)and line wi[ndow,](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/framework-guides/deploy-a-react-site/) pass[ing in](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/framework-guides/deploy-a-svelte-site/) the `--url` flag with your [`localhost`](http://localhost) URL and port. `cloudflared` will output logs to your command line, including a banner with a tunnel URL:

**Terminal window**

```bash
cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:3000
```

# **Create a remotely-managed tunnel (dashboard)**

Follow this step-by-step guide to get your first tunnel up and running using Zero Trust.

## **Prerequisites**

Before you start, make sure you:

* [Add a website to Cloudflare](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/setup/manage-domains/add-site/).
    
* [Change your domain nameservers to Cloudflare](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/zone-setups/full-setup/setup/).
    

## **1\. Create a tunnel**

1. Log in to [Zero Trust ↗](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com/) and go to **Networks** &gt; **Tunnels**.
    
2. Select **Create a tunnel**.
    
3. Choose **Cloudflared** for the connector type and select **Next**.
    
4. Enter a name for your tunnel. We suggest choosing a name that reflects the type of resources you want to connect through this tunnel (for example, `enterprise-VPC-01`).
    
5. Select **Save tunnel**.
    
6. Next, you will need to install `cloudflared` and run it. To do so, check that the environment under **Choose an environment** reflects the operating system on your machine, then copy the command in the box below and paste it into a terminal window. Run the command.
    
7. Once the command has finished running, your connector will appear in Zero Trust.
    
    ![Connector appearing in the UI after cloudflared has run](https://developers.cloudflare.com/_astro/connector.DgDJjokf_IrBTB.webp align="left")
    
8. Select **Next**.
    

The next steps depend on whether you want to [connect an application](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/get-started/create-remote-tunnel/#2-connect-an-application) or [connect a network](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/get-started/create-remote-tunnel/#3-connect-a-network).

## **2\. Connect an application**

Follow these steps to connect an application through your tunnel. If you are looking to connect a network, skip to the [Connect a network section](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/get-started/create-remote-tunnel/#3-connect-a-network).

1. In the **Public Hostnames** tab, choose a **Domain** and specify any subdomain or path information.
    
2. Specify a service, for example `https://localhost:8000`.
    
3. Under **Additional application settings**, specify any [parameters](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/configure-tunnels/origin-configuration/) you would like to add to your tunnel configuration.
    
4. Select **Save tunnel**.
    

## **3\. Connect a network**

Follow these steps to connect a private network through your tunnel.

1. In the **Private Networks** tab, add an IP or CIDR.
    
2. Select **Save tunnel**.
    

## **4\. View your tunnel**

After saving the tunnel, you will be redirected to the **Tunnels** page. Look for your new tunnel to be listed along with its active connector.
